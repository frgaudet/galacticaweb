# Main goal

[EGG is an open-source framework](https://github.com/karimalami7/EGG) for generating evolving RDF graphs based on finely-tuned temporal constraints given by the user.

# Excerpt

We use the platform to thoroughly evaluate EGG. More precisely, we evaluate the highly-expressive constraints that the user can specify in EGG to generate evolving graphs over various real-world use cases, the accuracy and scalability of the generator, and the ease of using EGG in performance comparisons of evolving graph processing systems.

# Resources used

16 x 2.4 GHz CPU, 64 GB RAM, and 160 GB disk.

# Software used 

- [EGG](https://github.com/karimalami7/EGG) that we built on top of [gMark](https://github.com/graphMark/gmark)
- Our own implementation of an algorithm found in the TimeReach paper : see [here](http://openproceedings.org/2015/conf/edbt/paper-89.pdf)

# Dataset used

[Five real-world use cases](https://github.com/karimalami7/EGG/tree/master/use_cases)
