# Excerpt

We use the platform to perform automatic security evaluation of block ciphers using constraint programming. In particular, we perform related key differential cryptanalysis on several block ciphers, including AES.

# Resources used (RAM CPU etc...)

16 VCPU, 64Gb of ram.

# Software used

The MiniZinc suite, Picat and Choco.

# Expected results

Obtaining optimal related key cryptanalysis of AES (done) and other block ciphers (work in progress), and performing other kinds of cryptanalysis (work in progress).
